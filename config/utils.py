GOOGLE UTILITIES MODULE
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This module provides **utility functions** to support the  
Google Ads data pipeline, focusing on reusable and generic  
helpers that keep the main ETL code clean and maintainable.

It acts as a shared toolkit used across different components  
of the pipeline, reducing duplication and centralizing  
common logic.

✔️ Handles environment variable parsing and secrets retrieval  
✔️ Provides string manipulation and formatting helpers  
✔️ Supports error handling and logging utilities  

⚠️ This module does *not* define schema or ETL process logic.  
It only contains supportive utilities to simplify and  
standardize code across the pipeline.
